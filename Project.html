      This is a gaming web site started 1 year ago by a 26 years old italian
      guy who moved away from his hometown to try having a better life.
      <br />
      Moving to Edinburgh, Scotland he made possible for himself realizing one
      of his biggest hobbies, become a gamer!
      <br />
      Starting on the 26th Decembr 2021, within only one week he managed to
      make live stream every day for few weeks.
      <br />
      Day after day he reached more than 100 followers which might seem only a
      few but he started growing.
      <br />
      After a while people started asking him to play toghether.
      <br />
      Plaiyng games like League Of Legend and getting better every match at
      it, people started seeing his potential until he reached the affiliation
      with Twitch. He made possible for himself with all his hardwork to
      create his own merchandise helping him to grow more and more. One day he
      hopes to reach more and more people making this hobby into a full time
      job.
